Follow along for a ride across the universe!TL;DR: Not Shakespeare, not complex, but fun and easy to read. Come support! As the translator, I've enjoyed translating this novel and I hope to bring the essence of what the author has tried to portray into the chapters you will read.To sum it up in 3 words: Mechs! Explosions! Science!To be perfectly honest, this novel is about your typically overpowered protagonist who does get looked down from time to time but always overcomes the odds with his own special power. He's abit more mature having grown up on his own and just a littttttttle bit dense.Although it always ends up with him winning, it always happens in an interesting (subjective) and fun way that makes me enjoy reading this.The novel has elements of lighthearted comedy from time to time and I do chuckle at how direct the humor is.It's not as smart as say WMW nor does it weave an intricate story much like Ergen's novels. More importantly, its fun and it doesn't try to hide it.  ",522,4.11,4.1494255,4.1609197,4.019157,4.0957856,4.1494255,1
