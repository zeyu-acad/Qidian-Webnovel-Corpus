# Qidian-Webnovel-Corpus

An brief introduction to the **Qidian-Webnovel** Corpus.

The corpus creation process involved a manual search for translated novels available on **Webnovel.com** within the **NOVEL** category, only targeting **completed works**.

Subsequently, each identified translated novel was mapped with its original counterpart on **Qidian.com**. 

As a result, we got 120 novels (from which 10 of these novels' copyright on Qidian.com had expired, so no data for this 10 novels on Qidian) 

The final corpus consists of **110** novels. 

We also collected the user profiles of readers who has left comments or replies on the novels. 
**We only collect personal data that are necessary for the purpose of the scientific research, and strictly abid by the GDPR.**
